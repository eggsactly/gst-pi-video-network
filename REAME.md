gst-pi-video-network contains four scripts that allow two Raspberry Pi on a 
network to transmit and receive video to and from each other. 

The scripts assume that both Pis each have a Logitech C920 attached to them, 
which do H264 encode internally. The Raspberry Pis transmit the video and 
decode on the receving end.
